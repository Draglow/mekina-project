# Django Car Seller Website

Welcome to our Django Car Seller Website! This platform is designed to streamline the process of buying and selling cars online, providing users with a seamless experience from browsing to purchasing.

This is my first project, developed by following a tutorial, and serves as a foundational step in my journey as a web developer.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system for buyers and sellers.
- **Browse Cars**: Extensive catalog of cars with filtering options by make, model, price, etc.
- **Search Functionality**: Advanced search functionality to find specific cars based on various criteria.
- **Contact Sellers**: Integrated messaging system to communicate with sellers directly.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admin panel for managing users, listings, and site settings.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices.
